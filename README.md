# TextSafe
This is a simple encryption and decryption model fully implemented on Python.
Here the basic that we have included is adding the encrypted file directly to the Google Drive.
Once the encrypted file is uploaded then we can just download the encrypted file and again decrypt using the key
When we click on encrypt button it will once create keys textdoc and saves the keys of encrypted file using file name.
we have used a simple fernet module for the encryption and decryption.
